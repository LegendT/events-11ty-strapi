## Reasons you should come

Previous Collaborates have shown us there’s no real point in predicting what is going to unfold - from a jazz quartet performing live to show us the benefits of making mistakes, practising our deep breathing to calm our vagus nerves with Annette Priest, or Monzo revealing how they built a bank from the ground up – there’s no such thing as a boring Collaborate talk.

But it’s not just the big ideas you can look forward to this year.

It’s equally about getting the South West’s digital community together - to pool ideas and innovate as we ponder some of life’s bigger questions, and generally celebrate what a thriving hub we’ve become.
